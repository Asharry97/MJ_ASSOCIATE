                    This is a giant sector that encompasses banks, financial institutions and all other possible
                    financing transactions in every industry. Enactment of the RBI Act 1935 gave birth to scheduled
                    banks in India, and some of these banks had already been established around 1981. Our expertise in
                    Banking and Finance covers acquisition, global loans, restructuring, SARFEASI (Securitization and
                    Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest ) as per the Act of the same
                    name enforced in 2002 which deals with any kind of secured loan where the banks have the right to
                    seize or auction the secured assets in case the loan is not repaid and becomes a Non-Performing
                    Asset and various regulatory issues pertaining to the area. These cases do not require a Court’s
                    intervention. Hence, such a procedure of auction or seizure or any other related matter is dealt
                    with in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) as mentioned in the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and
                    Financial Institutions Act, 1993.
