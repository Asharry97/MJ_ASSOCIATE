                    Customs in India, like in other countries are responsible to clear the imported or export goods after proper checking whether they are importable/exportable under various rules made by different ministries for different products as per licensing/approvals required and for collection of duties. Further, they implement various concessions, exemptions that are given to a certain class of products, depending upon their end-use, source country or under certain schemes of DGFT.

                    Customs looks at the valuation of the goods while importing and exporting because most of the import duties and export incentives are based on the value of the goods. Further, it is important from the perspective of proper foreign exchange outflow or inflow. Valuation of the goods is done under Section 14 of the Customs Act 1962, and as per Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 & Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Export Goods) Rules 2007. Customs assess the goods and their value presented by the importer. Upon assessment the goods are allowed for clearance upon payment of duty.

                    Special Valuation Branch of the customs deals with cases involving related party transactions and follows a procedure as laid down in the circulars issued by CBEC from time to time. The procedure involves investigation spread over a period of time and requires the importer to reply to a set of questionnaire and also maintain documentation and furnish the information as and when required. After the investigation, the customs may accept or reject the value. On rejection, the value is re-determined based on the sequential methodology (identical/similar valuation, deductive valuation, computed valuation, residual valuation). At times such a re-determination may involve the imposition of fine and penalty depending on the reasons of rejection of the value.

                    AEO (Authorised Economic Operation) status is a certified standard authorisation issued by customs administrations in the European Union (EU).
