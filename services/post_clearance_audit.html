                    Customs Post Clearance Audit (PCA) is an initiative based on global best practices. It is aimed at creating an environment of increased compliance while allowing the Department the flexibility to enhance the facilitation for importers and exporters. PCA allows Customs to reduce border controls by shifting compliance checks from the clearance stage to the post clearance stage. In Indian Customs, Post clearance audit was first introduced in 2005 (when the Risk Management System was operationalized). It replaced the conventional system of concurrent audit, which formed a part of the assessment process by separating audit function from assessment function, thereby facilitating expeditious clearance of goods. It consists of

                    A new scheme has been started by the customs department in the name and title "On site post clearance Audit". The Ministry is going to cover all importers under this scheme very soon. Under this new Audit system the officers of Ministry of Finance will visit the premises of Importers and Audit the Customs clearance documents at their premises. It is natural that Officers will raise the Audit objections and importers have to submit reply of the Audit objections. Secondly the importers are now required to keep their import documents in a systematic and auditable manner. Since importers are busy in their business activity and finances, it will be difficult from them to face the Audit team of Officers. In view of above facts and to facilitate the importers our company has established a new department and trained this department to handle the work of onsite post clearance Audit of our customers.
